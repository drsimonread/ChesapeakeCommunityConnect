# Chesapeake Community Connect

## About CCC

The Chesapeake Community Connect website serves as a hub for improving connections and knowledge exchange within the Chesapeake Community. Its core function is to encourage users to share their environmental stories in audiovisual formats; specifically, the website shall focus on community solutions and the current innovation involved in finding solutions to environmental conflicts. The platform features an accessible user interface accompanied with a designated page explaining the user interface and its capabilities, content submission capabilities, admin oversight for safety, a filtering system for efficient content discovery, and an interactive map system highlighting community-related locations. It ensures seamless access on both mobile and desktop devices through the Google Chrome browser, facilitating widespread community engagement and knowledge sharing.
