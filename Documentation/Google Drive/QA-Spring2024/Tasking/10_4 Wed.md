Happy Wednesday :) 

Isabella:

- [ ] Kylie is scheduling a meeting with the customer most likely next week. We will most likely need to show her an extremely rough draft of the UI with 2 examples of how it could look. (We can go over this in class separately together\!)

John & Naheed:

- [x] ~~Ensure you are referring to the sample SRS (this will help out\!)~~  
- [x] ~~Work on subsections for “2.2 Website Functionality” section in the SRS (i.e. 2.2.1, 2.2.2, …).~~  
- [x] ~~Continue within your section(s) and fill in specific “shall” statements wherever possible~~  
      

Brittany & Malik:

- [ ] Ensure you are referring to the sample SRS (this will help out\!)  
- [ ] Work on subsections for “2.1 Website Display” section in the SRS (i.e. 2.1.1, 2.1.2, …). I know this is hard because we are hitting road blocks with customer requirements but just use it as an opportunity to think through what info we still need from the customer\!   
- [ ] Continue within your section(s) and fill in specific “shall” statements wherever possible  
      

Yaro:

- [ ] Think of new main headers (i.e. 2.1, 2.2, …) and work on filling out any new sections that you create with “shall” statements.  
- [ ] When Kylie gets out of her meeting we are working together\!

Kylie:

- [x] ~~Meet with Isabella~~  
- [x] ~~Meet with Shameer and Lily \- note to self (Does the customer want the map on the main page?)~~  
- [ ] Report back to group (discuss the meeting/outcomes)  
- [ ] Work with the team to solve the SRS troubles\!
