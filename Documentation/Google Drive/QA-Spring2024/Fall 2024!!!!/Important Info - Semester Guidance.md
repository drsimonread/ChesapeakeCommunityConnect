**To Do:**  
Overall, the Traceability Matrix is the next big step. The test procedures have been reviewed but their connection to the SRS has not.

Website QA Additions

- [ ] 

Video:

- [ ] Create a video (folder in documents called video obtains a starter script) that introduces all of the work put into the project, explain story, what prompted this project, how was the organization of the project split, etc.. This video should be placed within the website with the QR Code leading directly to it.  

SRS (Software Requirement Specification Document):

- [x] ~~Adding an editing option (similar to delete) for all accounts within the Admin Page. The Admin could edit the name of an account, the email, phone number, … and whatever other info is appropriate. It’s up to R\&D if this should be a pop-up display box with the editable info, if the info is automatically editable in the line of info after double-clicking edit, or if they want it to be a separate page.~~  
- [x] ~~Adding in functionality to open up a specific contribution/upload through clicking on a button labeled “view more” at the bottom of the descriptive box which will open up a new page that lists that contribution along with all other contributions within that same area/on that same pin. Refer to SRS~~   
- [x] ~~Adding functionality to the requirement “2.1.5.8 Admin Add a Filter”. The process is currently unknown and only the button will exist on the webpage. Ask R\&D how it is set up in the database (info necessary to add a filter) and in general, what this process is.~~

STP (Software Test Plan)

- [x] ~~All tests were written in relation to the SRS but none have been tested. Reach out if any questions/comments/concerns arise.~~

MISC:

- [x] ~~Traceability matrix~~  
- [ ] User Manual (continuing working on the User Manual, QA 2024-\>Documents \-\> user manual)   
- [x] ~~If there is extra time and people, have one person with creative talents create a flier for the customer that advertises the website. Includes a QR code to the website.~~  
- [x] ~~R\&D to make a function where each contributor will have an individual profile (make it so that~~   
- [x] ~~Have some down time? You could have someone work on creating a PIVOT table within the STP excel test tracker to track progress~~
