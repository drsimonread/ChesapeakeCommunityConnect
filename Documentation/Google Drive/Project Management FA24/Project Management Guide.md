Customer: Parisa Rinaldi, from ENST Dept, she is very sweet and communicative. Responds within a few days. 

Day to day: Communicate with your QA and R\&D leads. See if there is anything they need from you, or if they need you to pass on any info to Parisa/ask her any questions.   
I’m not sure if Simon will change the way things work, but this semester we have an alternating week schedule where one monday we do a scrum and the next monday we do biweekly reports and timesheets. 

Scrums: You will be leading these, but it is not difficult at all. Have each person stand up and say a few sentences answering the following questions:

1. What have you done since we last had a scrum?  
2. What are you going to do this cycle?  
3. Is there anything in your way?

This should move quickly and not take more than 10 mins. 

Biweekly reports: You will be in charge of condensing the reports from R\&D and QA into one report each and send that on to Simon. Everyone will send their reports to their lead, the leads will send all of them to you. Read through them and create a document that has all the important highlights from the reports all in one document for Simon to look over. This is tedious bit not difficult. 

This is not a difficult job, you’ll be fine.
