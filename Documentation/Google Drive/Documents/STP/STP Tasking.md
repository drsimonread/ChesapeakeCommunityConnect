PLEASE READ ME :))  
Don’t hesitate to ask me any questions. I would much rather us all get right on the first go around\! No questions are bad questions\!

❓How do I write a test procedure?  
	Reference the sample docs\! Navigate to “Sample Docs” → “Systems Squad \- STP-3 (1)” and scroll down to the big chart (these are test procedures).   
	THE BIG DIFFERENCE is that we will be formatting ours in an excel sheet this time around, not in a word doc as seen in “Systems Squad \- STP-3 (1)”. 

❓Where do I put my test procedures?  
	In the excel labeled “STP Testing Tracking.xlsx” in the folder “Excel Test Tracker”

❓How do I format it like the others?  
	Press shift+enter to continue writing in the same cell, continuing your text

❓What is the Test \# in the Excel?  
	It is a relevant identifying ID for the test. This is useful when a traceability matrix will be made (probably next semester)  
	If you have a test case called Map Pins under “2.1 Website Display” you should call it WDMP-2.1

❓I finished all of my test cases.. Now what?  
	Find a section in the SRS that doesn’t have a comment “Active”. Comment your name on the section title and let Kylie know you finished and that you’re moving onto a new section please\!  
	Kylie can also direct you to a new section, no problem. Just ask\!
