- Worried that things aren't integrated yet  
  - Would like to see something deployed to azure so everyone can work on it   
- Concerned with duplication of effort between QA and R\&D  
  - Necessary to some extent, because of hazy specifications  
  - Needs more CLARIFICATION, the issue is not communication  
- Wants CDSpec to function correctly, wants something to exhibit and demonstrate that we are supporting customers after we have completed the project  
  - More a PR thing than driven by the customer
