- Two possibilities:  
  - Project local, and international project in columbia  
    - Two separate projects  
  - Could there be a playformt o serve both purposes, or should we focus on the local project?  
  - Columbia team considering a platform themselves, she can share it with us for us to think about it

Map: Malik & Sam

1. Markers. In the legend of the example website, there are map markers that tell whether something involves nuclear waste, tourism, etc. What kind of markers would the customer like to mark the map with?   
- Just a basic marker and explore different colors to differentiate   
2. What information would be available within the interactive map? (data sets, location, user info, date/time posted, comment, captions?, label for type of data set)   
- Descriptive info on case and category, but also the data sets can have embedded video or photo or links to news articles within the blurb  
3. Should the pins work like EJAtlas does or should they be links to full size pages, given the audio/visual representations?  
- She likes the option to not immediately go into full page, but you can choose to do so and see resources linked to it  
4. What is the scope of the map? (Include all of maryland, the us, just local …)   
- Keep this regional to chesapeake, she will share the other resource developed in mexico

Features: John & Matthew & Jordan

1. What would a resource hub look like and what might be included?   
- Wants it to be a place where info can be uploaded for research, but also people looking for initiative to join could find the site  
- Much like EJ Atlas including links to other resources, this should also link to other sites  
2. Describe what  is meant by linking audiovisual pieces to researched initiatives?  
- If site specific, then in addition to community members uploading descriptions of initiatives and stories, students would also be able to upload videos they take of oral histories by cite, in the same way community members would  
- In the general website, could there be a separate space where its not just the map, but a description of what does community resilience mean, what does sustainable business mean? In those about spaces, there could be short video blurbs that describe those things.   
3. How would QR codes be utilized? Should you scan the QR code in the real world and it shows you the businesses around you?  
- Platform is more useful if more peopl have access to it. Once its populated, we could put posters in key sites for people to share their info, could have them at libraries and stuff so people can scan qr code to access platform, or link them to tutorial on how to use these things  
4. Do you want a system to tag entries and sort by tags? Using this you could tag all entries by certain people or working towards certain goals and filter the entries to only those  
- Wants it to be if you click a tab, filters map so you only see filtered posts.   
- With EJ Atlas, can see tags associated with a given case, and you can click on that tag to see map of all the things with that tag \-- wants that  
- Open to ideas of visualization of tags  
- Interested in thinks being open source for definitions, so people can be constantly updating definitions and examples  
- Wants things to be as open source as possible, have ability to make own tags

Audio/Info Upload: Yaro & Alex

1. Do you want a commenting function available for the uploaded information  
- Worried that without enough oversight making sure things are appropriate, it might be a good idea to avoid comments  
- Would be good to have a forum for comments, but doesnt know where that space would be  
- Would be too overwhelming if comments came up with the blurb itself  
- Wants comments to perhaps be a little more abstract instead of for each entry, doesnt want it to be too specific to each place  
- Interested in more of an index view, with each tag having information on more specific things within the index view  
2. What would the audio/info submission ask for during submission?   
- Requires titles, who is uploading the info, the description  
- Will get back to us on more specifics on that, but perhaps some over all categories that are required and others that can be open to the user to decide if they wanna use them  
3. Is the goal to have an admin page where you will be able to verify or deny pending audio/info uploads?   
- Wants to have administration watch other things before they are posted  
- Things approved BEFORE being uploaded

UI: Isabella & Marjon

1. Is there anything you specifically like or dislike about the sample Environmental Justice (EJ) Atlas. For example, any specific layouts, navigation  
- EJ Atlas is a great resource, but focuses on CONFLICTS, wants to focus on solution, community, and innovation focused.   
- More audio/visual content, more personal stories in the form of videos  
- Could get pretty data heavy, so thats why EJ doesn't do it  
- Likes filtering aspect, but gets a little overwhelming. The simpler the design the better  
- Wants things to be as intuitive as possible to add into \- a bit difficult for a regular user to input info on EJA  
2. Any logo? Main colors? Social media icons?   
- Something hopeful rather than skeletons and hazard signs  
- Can provide one for us if we’d like, nothing in mind right now  
- We can experiment with designs and send them to her  
3. What will the homepage look like? How will the information be displayed?  
- Map right away, pop up on the map where you can go to the about page or immediately input info  
4. Web tabs(Home, Map, About, Contact)?   
- All the ones mentioned, within the about the main categories required for input should have their own section in the about or on another, to define the framework behind the categories.  
- A tutorial page on how to use the website   
5. Navigation  
- Something simple but similar to that

Account: Naheed & Garrett

1. Do you want users to have an account in order to view/upload/comment… or no account necessary?  
- No account necessary, as open source as possible  
2. Content Approval needed? Are submissions added to the website by you or by the students?   
- By the users, including students, but as previously discussed, content approval needed by admin  
3. Account Creation: do we want an email verification step for admin. If it’s class based, instead of open access to features like upload, possibly grant users access through whitelisting?  
- For admin, email verification will be required

Documentation: Brittany

1. Would the documentation being delivered via email for authorization for each version work for you?  
- Email is fine  
2. Any additional documents   
- Provide slides to her

- Questions:  
- Who will own the server? Who will own the data being uploaded?  
- Would be nice for things to be officially endorsed by the college

- Before next time, send questions ahead of time
