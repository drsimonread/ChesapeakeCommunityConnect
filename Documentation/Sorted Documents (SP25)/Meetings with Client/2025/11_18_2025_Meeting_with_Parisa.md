**Notes from Meeting with CCC Customer 11/18/2025**

**Attendees:**  
**FA25 Project Lead: Amy Weaver**  
**Customer: Parisa Rinaldi ([pnrinaldi@smcm.edu](mailto:pnrinaldi@smcm.edu))**

**Map Page**

- *Tag Titles*: Keep the same  
- *Search Bar*: Keep the same  
- *Map Pins*: Allow for one map pin to have multiple tags  
- *Submit Button*: Remove submit button for filtering tags on the map, it is a “confusing extra step”  
- *Map Instructions*: Place at the top of the page, above the map. Make sure they go across the length of the page, just like the alphabet does on the Contributor Page, for example.

**About Us Page**

- Currently, there are 3 sections on the page: R\&D, QA, Capstone  
  - Customer would like to narrow down to 2 total sections on the page  
  - Customer would like for R\&D/QA/Capstone to still be acknowledged, but combined into one section. She would like for the picture to be a group picture of one of the capstone classes.  
  - Customer would like for the other section to be for the research team.  
    - Parisa has shared a site link and said to use a description and photo from there for the time being  
      - *Coastal Community Resilience Site Link*: [https://coastalcommunitysm.wixsite.com/coastal-community-re/about](https://coastalcommunitysm.wixsite.com/coastal-community-re/about) 

**Help/FAQ Page**

- *Tutorial Video*: Customer wants us to make a screencast of the basic steps of uploading something to the map, and send that screencast over to her. She will then do a voiceover.  
- *FAQ Format*: Keep the same  
  - No new FAQ ideas at the moment  
- *Contact Button*: Keep the same

**Contributor Page**

- *Alphabet*: Keep the entire alphabet across the top as is  
  - Change letter text color to a lighter color upon hovering, to show a distinction.  
  - Remove visibility of hyperlinks (underlined style, blue text color)  
- *Membership List*: Maintain one list of all members on the Admin Page, including their membership types (group Banned members into the main list to keep things simplified).  
- *Test Data*: Customer would like for us to create our own test data for the contributor list, until the site has launched and users begin to make real accounts.

**Sign-Up and Sign-In Buttons**

- Keep both of these buttons the same  
- Future hopes/ideas from the customer:  
  - *Google Authentication*: Send an email to the user, click a link to verify that they are trying to sign in to the site.  
  - *Upload Photos/Videos*: Allow users to upload up to 1 photo OR video per pin upload (no discussion on limits for file sizes, this can be revisited down the road).
