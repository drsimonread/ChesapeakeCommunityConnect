**What is a contributor?** 

A contributor is an organization, community group, or initiative leading an environmental or social action project within the Chesapeake region. You are the local experts whose work makes a tangible difference every day. Our primary contributor is the St. Mary's College of Maryland student team, who will be actively reaching out to groups like yours to gather and verify project information, ensuring the map is comprehensive and accurate.

**Why should my organization contribute?** 

Contribute your initiative to the map to showcase your work to a broad audience of funders, policymakers, volunteers, and media; find partners with complementary goals, shared geographies, or similar thematic interests; and see your work in context.
