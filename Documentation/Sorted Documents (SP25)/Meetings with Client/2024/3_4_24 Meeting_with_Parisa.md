Creating a post for users, should that be on the main page or on contributors page?

- Should be more on managing the account side, so wwe could expand the types of posts that we request. Could be limiting to have it on the map itself.  
- Helps to have contributing stuff less of account interface, ut instead a ‘contributor profile’

  - Important that the post be easy to trace  
- Interested in a small visual component on the page if the post has it

Wants personalized tags, a place to suggests NEW kids of tags  
	\-”if you think a tag is missing, let us know\!”

Wants to get a better grasp on what kind of questions will be answered with this website

- Maybe write out text to explain what we're looking for  
- Each profile should have a tab which is specifically addressing further research questions for the work  
  - Could be good to put in skills, needs, AND questions.  
- Not necessarily something the company is currently thinking of, we pose questions like ‘if you could learn something that would help your program improve, what would you want to learn or ask?’  
- This could be a series of prompts for your bio when you are making your account  
  - Just has to be in the description

Make it more of a forum for if people in the college want to do work for a business that cares about what you do. “Oh, that organization is asking questions i want to do research on, I should reach out to them”

Is email for admin eyes only, or can the general public see it?

- Would be helpful for people to also be able to see it to use it to network, also like the website

When a post is denied, should we put in a reason for denial?

- Yes, then they can try to fix it and try again

For account deletion, do you want it to be wiped or do you want the account to keep existing but just cant post anymore?

- Wants to keep the accounts
