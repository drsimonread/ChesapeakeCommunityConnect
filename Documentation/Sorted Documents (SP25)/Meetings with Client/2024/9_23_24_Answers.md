## An Overview of the Project.

The Project is an environmentally friendly website designed for researchers and members of the community to find interesting solutions to environmental problems. Similar to other websites (see EJAtlas), this website focuses on the Chesapeake bay area.

A Contributor may create a Forum.  
Forums *must* contain a Title, Body, and Geolocation.  
	Forums *may* contain Media or Tags.  
	Forums *must* be marked as Public or Private.  
Forums *must* be flagged for whether the Contributor who created the Forum is associated with who/whatever created the solution.

Once a Forum has been created, it goes into a Pending state.  
	In a Pending state, Forums cannot be seen on the Website.  
	Forums leave a Pending state when they have been Approved or Denied.  
		Administrators and Moderators can Approve a Forum or Deny it.  
		Approved Forums go live and appear on the Website.  
		Denied Forums do not appear on the Website.  
When an Admin or Mod Denies a Forum, they specify the reason it has for being Denied. The Contributor can then attempt to create a new Forum, or they can attempt to appeal the Denied Forum.

Once a Forum has been Approved, it can be viewed by any User and it appears on the Map.

If the Forum has been marked Public, any Contributor may create a Post on the Forum and create a Comment on any Post.  
Any User may see any Post and Comment on the Forum.  
If the Forum has been Marked as Private, only Contributors who have been invited to the Forum may see Posts and Comments and create Posts and Comments.  
Any user who has not been invited to the Forum may still see the Forum, but they cannot see any Posts or Comments on the Forum.  
		They will see a Request Access button, indicating that the Forum is Private.  
			Clicking it will send a request to Admins, Mods, and the Forum Creator.  
	The Forum creator, Admins, or Mods may grant any Contributor access to the Forum.  
		The Forum creator, Admins, or Mods may revoke access to the Forum.  
Admins and Mods can view all Forums as if they were invited, although they will still be able to tell if the Forum is Public or Private.

Any Contributor with access to a Forum (either due to the Forum being Public or because they were granted access to a Private Forum), may create Posts and Comments on that Forum.  
Posts *must* contain a Title and Body.  
Posts *may* contain Media.  
Posts *should/may* contain User-Defined Tags.  
Comments *must* contain a Body.  
If the Comment is a reply to a Comment, it *must* contain a reference to the Comment it is replying to. (This is more akin to YouTube’s comment section than Reddit’s. Most likely the reference will be the Contributor’s Username. This needs to be workshopped more.)

Forums *should* contain a way to search by date and last modified (Comments, Posts, and Edits).  
Posts *should* contain a way to search by date and last modified (Comments and Edits).  
Posts *should* contain a way to search by User-Defined Tags.  
Comments *should* contain a way to search by date.
