## An overview of the project.

The project, to my understanding, is similar to EJAtlas, only for Solutions as Opposed to Problems (also based on the Chesapeake Area). Furthermore, you had mentioned in a previous meeting that Posts may be made on behalf of a company or individual that is providing the Solution. That feature does not currently exist, although it could be added.  
/\\  
So, following that idea, and please do correct me if what I’m describing differs from your vision for the website, but:  
Users would be allowed to make Posts based on Solutions to problems they have found in the Chesapeake Area (specifically related to Environmentally conscious Situations).  
These Posts would contain a title, a body (description of the Situation), media of the Situation (videos and images), a geolocation of the Situation, tags that the Situation is related to, and whether or not the User is related to the individual, company, or organization that is conduction the Solution to the Situation.  
Those Posts then go into a Pending state while they await approval from an Admin (or Moderator, see the Accounts tab).  
If approved, the Post would go live, appearing on the main map, allowing other Users to click on the Post and read about the Situation.  
Once the Post has been selected, Users could Comment on the Post, discussing the Situation and Solution and other topics surrounding them.

## What is posting?

In a formal attempt to define terminology, I would like to establish what, exactly, posting is.

Currently, a “Post” is an object that must contain a title, body, and geolocation and can contain media (videos and images) and tags. All of these are created by the author of the post (discussed further down the page).

Is that definition of a Post accurate to your vision? If not, how would it change?

CURRENT POSTS ARE NOW CALLED FORUMS. Following that train of thought, would NEW Posts have the ability to contain media? Comments probably no.

### What is commenting?

Reading through some of the prior meeting notes, I have come to the conclusion that you want Comments on Posts to be a feature. That feature does not exist currently, although creation wouldn’t be too difficult.

If Comments are still a part of your vision, how would they be represented? That is to say, would they be sorted by recency, is there a like/dislike feature, can someone reply to a Comment (can someone reply to that Comment (if so, would the Comments stack like they do on forums like Reddit?)), and can the user select from sorting options?

What would make up a Comment? Would they just be the body, could they have media or a geolocation, could they have a title or tags?

## What Accounts are there?

Internally, there are currently four types of Users (Banned, Signed-out, Signed-in, and Trusted), however, permissions can be managed individually and there could be many more types of Users. For that reason, I’d like to ask, in your vision, what Accounts are there?

For concrete definitions, Administrators are Users that have access to the back-end, they can delete Posts, Comments, they can ban Users, and they can create more Administrators (currently, this is the Trusted User, but that can (and should) be changed).

If I’m not correct, in your vision, any Signed-in User can post, but those Posts are not visible until they are approved. Admins should have this power, but I’d like to put forth a lesser User that exclusively has that ability (Trusted User, Moderator, Approver, etc.). This way trusted members of the community can be given the ability to allow Posts to appear without having the ability to destroy the website.

Do you have a vision for any other types of Accounts?

### Who can Post?

Roughly a year ago, you mentioned that you wanted the website to be as open access as possible. Mentioning that Admins should have to verify their emails, but that an account should not be necessary for posting.

That system is not currently in place. However, since all Posts need to be approved by an Admin (or approving specific User), allowing Signed-out Users to Post could work (since spam or bots wouldn’t be a thing as all Posts must be approved). Do you still want that, or would you rather force Users to create an Account in order to post?

#### Who can Comment?

Commenting as a system is not in place. If it were to exist, who could do it? Signed-out Users, Signed-in Users, Trusted Users? Would the creator of the Post be allowed to delete Comments on their own Post? Would Comments have to be approved in a similar process to approving Posts? Perhaps having the Post creator approve the Comments instead of an Admin (or approving specific User)?
