Meeting 10/4/23 \-\> Lily, Kylie, Shameer

1\) The current purpose of the website is to highlight positive work being done in relation to environmental/sustainability projects with innovation and information sharing. Considering this, is a comment/discussion-based feature necessary to implement if it isn't contributing to the purpose of the website? This would include taking an approach to "feature" or "highlight" individual researchers and organizations in a database approach rather than initiating conversation alongside the posts with the chance of most not contributing to the goal. 

- Are we focusing on organizations or innovations?  
- Do the reviews contribute anything?

2\) We are considering taking a new approach to the Organization account sign-up. We are considering having a separate page on the website called "Organizations" where the people who want to submit their organization or an individual's specific portfolio of research/experiences for approval can do so. This means that when a person accesses the site without posting to it, there will be no prompt to login, they will just be a viewer. If this is accepted, I would then wonder if, within this page, there should be highlights of all the individuals and organizations where you can access their specific accounts (If we want profile creation \- which will be a project that will go into next semester).

- When org creates account, put in their info to store in database  
  - Users can click on pins from org and click on their posting name to see a text window pop up and give more into on the account, instead of going to a separate web page w the orgs info  
  - filter individual and orgs separate

We are considering taking a new approach to the Organization account sign-up. We are considering having a separate page on the website called "Organizations" where the people who want to create an account for their organization or an individual's specific portfolio of research/experiences can do so. This means that when a person accesses the site without intending to post to it, there will be no prompt to login, they will just be a viewer. On the technical side, this would mean that when an organization creates an account, they will fill in info about it and that will be stored in a database. Once they are approved and post a pin, the user can then click on their post to open a textbox that gives more info on the organization.   
Are you interested in having a page that lists all of the organizations that have been approved for the user to see?  
We are also considering creating a tag system separate from the pin tags to classify the organization types. So each organization would have a tag describing what type of business they are or what they are focused on, and the user could also filter by these classes. 

4\) Yaro had a great idea about rethinking the map as a whole. Instead of opening the map and having a bunch of pins (and the issue of having many pins in one location) he imagined the map with a list of organizations or environmental groups (agriculture, marine sciences, ...) that the user can select and pins will then show up on the map for what is selected) \--\> I can draw it out in our discussion on Wednesday. Overall, this may be more engaging to its users and doesn't copy the 2 websites we are currently referring to (it will be a new fun experience rather than a copy and paste)  
How cool would it be to click on one environmental group and see all of the options for that specific niche pop up rather than looking at a map full of a bunch of different pins \- easier navigation)

- Map starts empty, you choose to add on what you want to see instead of removing what you don't want, makes it more unique

We are considering reworking how the map works upon entry to the website. Instead of having all pins start on and having users filter them out, we are instead thinking of having the pins start off, and have the option to choose what exactly you are interested in to avoid being overwhelmed. 

3\) If Question \#4 is rejected: Consider an organization that wants to upload multiple experiences to one location, such as a farm. Would it be feasible to click on the pin and the most recent update to this area appear in a pop-up text box? From this step, the user can click on "see more" (or something similar) within this text box and will now see, in a thread-like fashion, each of the posts from most recent to least recent. We could also attempt to add a filter option to filter all of the posts, but this may go into next semester. 

- Do we want information from a given organization in a thread style or something more news aggregate style?  
- If more than one post is made about a site, do we want it to be counted as separate pins, or group pins by location? 

Leading into next semester:  
\- Profile creation for users (If this is something she wants)  
\- If we rework the map, they could add a perimeter to the selected environmental groups instead of pins (like an amorphous blob to represent the project scope area) (I can draw this out)  
\- Setting up the Organizations page fully

We should come up with a minimum goal for this semester. What will our end product include/what is possible?

- Get map and database set up  
- Get audio/visual function set up (possibility)  
- Accessibility/help page

Contributor \- brief â€œdo you want to contribute?
