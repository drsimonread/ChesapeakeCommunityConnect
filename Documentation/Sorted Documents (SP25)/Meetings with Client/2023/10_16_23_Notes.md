Question 1

- Comments/discussion not necessary  
- Focusing on the WORK BEING DONE, not the organizations doing them  
  - Not everyone has to be an organization to input data, could be individual people doing work

Question 2

- Will have some accounts that are more organized and some that are not, will have some people putting information on behalf of an organization or person. If the account page can have a place to select whether they ARE the org, or if they are just representing them, whether they have the consent to do so  
  - Separate lists by researchers and orgs, manually add others that havent created accounts  
- For now everyone will be smcm students, but hopefully can be expanded wider  
- 

Question 3

- Likes this idea

Question 4

- Would help the pins look more organized, interested in most recent post first

Question from QA: Login/sign up from orgs \- should the sign in page be on the main page, should it be nested in the org page?

- Call it ‘contributor’, have a little ‘do you want to contribute/ sign up here\!’ thing in the contributors page 

Mockups discussion from SDD

- She likes it\!\! Very clean and well designed  
- For the bottom or off to the right would display info about the upload, show who uploaded it, description, tags, etc  
- Instead of saying ‘project A/ project B’, would be subtags, not specific filters
