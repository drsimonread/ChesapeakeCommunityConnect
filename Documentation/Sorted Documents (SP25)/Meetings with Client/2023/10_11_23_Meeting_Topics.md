Hello Parisa,  
We have a few questions about the project as we are moving forward. If you'd be available to do so, we would like to meet next Wednesday. Per your request, I'm going to attach the questions we have in mind, which will be expanded upon when we meet. 

1\)  The current purpose of the website is to highlight positive work being done in relation to environmental/sustainability projects with innovation and information sharing. Considering this, is a comment/discussion-based feature necessary to implement if it isn't contributing to the purpose of the website? This would include taking an approach to "feature" or "highlight" individual researchers and organizations in a database approach rather than initiating conversation alongside the posts with the chance of most not contributing to the goal. 

2\) We are considering taking a new approach to the Organization account sign-up. We are considering having a separate page on the website called "Organizations" where the people who want to create an account for their organization or an individual's specific portfolio of research/experiences can do so. This means that when a person accesses the site without intending to post to it, there will be no prompt to login, they will just be a viewer. On the technical side, this would mean that when an organization creates an account, they will fill in info about it and that will be stored in a database. Once they are approved and post a pin, the user can then click on their post to open a textbox that gives more info on the organization.

2a) Are you interested in having a page that lists all of the organizations that have been approved for the user to see?

2b) We are also considering creating a tag system separate from the pin tags to classify the organization types. So each organization would have a tag describing what type of business they are or what they are focused on, and the user could also filter by these classes. Are you interested in that? 

3\) We are considering reworking how the map works upon entry to the website. Instead of having all pins start on and having users filter them out, we are instead thinking of having the pins start off, and have the option to choose what exactly you are interested in to avoid being overwhelmed. Do you have a preference for one style over the other? 

4\) When viewing the map, consider the case where there are multiple pins within a very close radius, for the same location. Would you prefer to have the information be viewed in a thread style, presenting the most recent posts for the location first? The user could then click on a 'see more' button to expand the post and previous posts. 

I apologize for the onslaught of questions. Please let me know if you are available on Wednesday, I look forward to hearing from you\!
