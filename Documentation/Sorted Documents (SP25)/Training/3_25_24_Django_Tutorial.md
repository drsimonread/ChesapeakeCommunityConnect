Files in Django:  
(from [https://testdriven.io/blog/django-static-files/](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-static-files/) )

First off, you'll typically find these three types of files in a Django project:

1. Source code: These are your core Python modules and HTML files that make up every Django project, where you define your models, views, and templates.  
2. Static files: These are your CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, fonts, and images. Since there's no processing involved, these files are very energy efficient since they can just be served up as is. They are also much easier to cache.  
3. Media file: These are files that a user uploads.
