How to create a Static QR code for the website flier using qrcode-monkey.com 

1. Identify the Url you want to link to your QR code. For our website the url is still in progress but I used the original url [https://interactivemap.azurewebsites.net/](https://interactivemap.azurewebsites.net/)   
2. From there you get to set your colors, I used \#F1D924 for a gold color in the foreground and \#2C2493 for a navy colored background.  
3. Then you can set an image in the middle of the QR code if you choose, I used the college seal in order to establish that the involvement of the college in the creation of the QR code  
4. Then you click create QR code and download as a png so that you can add it to whatever you need to. 

The reason we wanted a static qr code is because that way it will work without the host website, the static QR code will not expire so long as the linked website is still up.
