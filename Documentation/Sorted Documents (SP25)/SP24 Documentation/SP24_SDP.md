# **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

## **1.1 Purpose** {#1.1-purpose}

The purpose of the Software Development Plan (SDP) is to present all information necessary to control the execution of the project. It describes the approach to the development of the software and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the development effort.

The following people use the Software Development Plan:

* The project manager uses it to plan the project schedule and resource needs, and to track progress against the schedule.  
* Project team members use it to understand what they need to do, when they need to do it, and what other activities they are dependent upon.

## **1.2 Scope** {#1.2-scope}

This Software Development Plan (SDP) establishes a thoroughly detailed overall plan for the software implementations, testing, deployment, and qualifications for the Environmental Justice (EJ) Atlas website.This SDP is broken into a total of five sections. Excluding the first section being the introduction, the remaining four sections individually cover the project overview (Section 2), project organization (Section 3\) and management process (Section 4), which go into detail pertaining to the information necessary to reference for the duration of development accurately. The approaches encompassed within this document are contingent on the product requirements provided by the client’s description as they were comprehended at the time of writing. The complete statement of the product requirements will soon officially be documented in the  
Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

# **4\. Management Process** {#4.-management-process}

## **4.1 Project Estimates** {#4.1-project-estimates}

There is no applicable cost to this project; The cost of the software shall be free. The application shall cost 15 weeks of time for the first iteration and may continue progress over the following year. 

## **4.2 Project Plan** {#4.2-project-plan}

### **4.2.1 Phase Plan** {#4.2.1-phase-plan}

Project phases shall be implemented sequentially using the waterfall model with some instances of iteration.Communication shall occur between the customer in both meetings throughout the development process as well as asking questions regularly through emails. Modeling shall not happen concurrently with coding and constructing the software, instead it shall be in sequential order.

### **4.2.2 Iteration Objectives** {#4.2.2-iteration-objectives}

The website application project will utilize the incremental framework activity from the Agile Method for completion; where iterations happen when necessary to complete tasks within sprints. Sprints will typically be two weeks long and may include overlapping objectives if necessary.

### **4.2.3 Releases** {#4.2.3-releases}

The outcome of this project will yield one website release over the entire project duration.

### **4.2.4 Project Schedule** {#4.2.4-project-schedule}

### **4.2.5 Project Resourcing** {#4.2.5-project-resourcing}

The type of staff required for this project include a project manager, research development team, and quality assurance team. The QA team consists of 6 members and one lead, and the RD team consists of 7 members and one team lead. 

## **4.3 Project Monitoring and Control** {#4.3-project-monitoring-and-control}

### **4.3.1 Requirements Management** {#4.3.1-requirements-management}

Changes made to the product requirements will be kept on an updated version of the SRS document that shall be shared with the client for their approval.

### **4.3.2 Quality Control** {#4.3.2-quality-control}

Defects will be recorded and tracked as Change Requests, and defect metrics will be gathered (see Reporting and Measurement below).

All deliverables are required to go through the appropriate review process, as described in the Development Case. The review is required to ensure that each deliverable is of acceptable quality, using guidelines and checklists.

Any defects found during review which are not corrected prior to releasing for integration must be captured as Change Requests so that they are not forgotten.

### **4.3.3 Reporting and Measurement** {#4.3.3-reporting-and-measurement}

Updated schedule estimates, and metrics summary reports, will be generated at the end of each iteration.

### **4.3.4 Risk Management** {#4.3.4-risk-management}

Risks will be identified in the Inception Phase and throughout the lifecycle of the project. Project risk is evaluated at least once per iteration and documented by the Team Lead. All risks will identify and rank risk likelihood and risk consequence, as well as mitigation steps.

### **4.3.5 Configuration Management** {#4.3.5-configuration-management}

Appropriate tools will be selected which provide a database of Change Requests and a controlled versioned repository of project artifacts.

All source code, test scripts, and data files are included in baselines. Documentation related to the source code is also included in the baseline, such as design documentation. All customer deliverable artifacts are included in the final baseline of the iteration, including executables.

The Change Requests are reviewed and approved by one member of the project, the Change Control Manager role.
